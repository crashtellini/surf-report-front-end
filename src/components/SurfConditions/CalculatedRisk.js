        <h1>Calculating Risk</h1>
        <p>Looking back on past conversations (or at times, arguments) with outsiders of the downhill scene who question our motives- be it law enforcement, concerned parents/local residents…etc., one theme I hear skaters say nearly every single time is that we are “taking a calculated risk.” And while a reassuring blanket statement conveying the idea that we put reasonable thought and care into our actions, I often find myself skeptical as to how much each individual calculates the dangers they expose themselves to. I’ve had enough time in the sport to see many people get in over their head and see the consequences, everything from broken bones, torn ligaments, dislocated shoulders to heavier cases such permanent paralysis or even death. With such consequences involved, it is especially important to understand how to best mitigate these risks and be around to skate another day. </p>

       

        <h2>Know Your Limits</h2>
        <p>This is a pretty basic concept. Skate within your skill level and try not to bite off more than you can chew. Progress slowly and in environments conducive to learning. When you are ready for the next step, your intuition is your best guide. Be honest with yourself “Is this something I can handle and am prepared for?” If the hill you are considering has 8 hairpins facing both directions and you only know how to slide one direction the answer is no. Sooner or later you will find yourself at a more “elite” level where you have the skill to reasonably take on any hill you see. For the rest of the article, that will be the target audience I am speaking to, though people of any skill level are well off to absorb this. 
</p>

        <h2>Variable Change</h2>
        <p>“Always account for variable change” a favorite quote from an gambling movie, but equally applicable in downhill skateboarding. The way I see it, the true mark of skill in a downhiller is not how they handle everything going as planned, but rather how they handle situations that present themselves unexpectedly. In this sport, reaction time and execution are critical elements to your well-being</p>

        <h2>Road Conditions</h2>
        <p>Good practice is to never skate a road without a visual inspection first. Conditions change day to day. Everything from road work to rock slides and wet patches can present dangerous hazards. Taking time to give a visual inspection can greatly reduce the risk here. The last thing you want to do is steam into a blind sweeper and find a rock slide in the road, forcing you to choose between busting lane or impacting a rock wall at 40+ mph. Visual inspection aside, road conditions vary run to run. You should always be anticipating having to react to an unexpected obstacle. 
</p>

       

        <h2>Weather</h2>
        <p>Pretty obvious, but If you are skating on a day with less than stellar weather there is a chance rain may start falling mid run. Plan ahead of time what you are going to do, whether you are comfortable taking the rest of the run or if you need to shut down. Wind is also a factor that will vary. Tail wind is going to push you faster, head wind will slow you down. Pavement temperature can cause the road to be slicker or a little gripper, be aware. </p>

        <h2>Traffic</h2>
        <p>Easily one of the biggest concerns. This is hands down the hardest variable to predict. Never underestimate driver incompetency. Most people don’t have good experience driving mountain roads and are not expecting people to be skating down the road. Especially prevalent on roads without double yellow lines, many drivers cut lane. Sucks. But that’s the reality. Best advice is to try to get an idea of where drivers are likely to make mistakes on the road. What corners are most likely to be cut? Are there driveways people might pull out of without looking? Some situations with cars present themselves out of nowhere. I’ve seen people parked in the middle of the road on the exit of a blind corner, reversing up the road in the wrong lane, pretty much everything imaginable. Think of the road ahead of you, constantly be scanning the road, be ready. This is one variable that unfortunately we have very little control over and I would be willing to say the most common reason for serious injury sustained in downhill. I personally have had the misfortune of meeting the hood of a truck busting lane and have 6 fake front teeth to show for it. Would not recommend. </p>

        <h2>Defensive Skateboarding</h2>
        <p>This is in direction conjunction to mitigating risk involving traffic. I had the “perfect world” mindset for a long time. In a perfect world, a driver won’t cut lane. In a perfect world, everyone looks before pulling out of a driveway. In a perfect world, nobody is going to be parked in the middle of the road on a blind corner. This is a dangerous mindset, and personally led to a bad accident. It bums me out that people cut lane and do stupid things that put other people at risk. But that doesn’t change the fact the we need to anticipate other people being dumb and start taking defensive measures for our own good. To give an example, there is a corner here locally that is perfectly set up to steam through and throw a nice right-hand drift. Going full speed into the corner and laying out a perfect drift is incredible, and well within the local crews’ skill level. Unfortunately, this is also the corner that people are most likely to cut. A lot of us have decided to start slowing down before the corner (Scandinavian flick) and take the slower line. As much as it sucks, the reward is instantaneous when a car cuts lane and you slowed down ahead of time, giving a disapproving headshake to the driver rather than a ride in an ambulance. Skate defensively, expect mistakes. Be aware of key areas on the road people make mistakes and adjust your lines accordingly. Open roads are not always the best environment for most efficient speed line. Understand that the fast line is often the roll of a dice. 
</p>

        <h2>Skate with a Buddy</h2>
        <p>Whenever possible, skate with a buddy. Having another person around can provide assistance in case of an accident. They can also be an extra set of eyes on the road for hazards.</p>

        <h2>Emergency Preparedness</h2>
        <p>Always carry a basic first aid kit and know how to use it. In case of an accident, it can be a lifesaver. Also, know your location and the fastest route to the nearest hospital.</p>

        <h2>Final Calculations</h2>
        <p>Just because the road can be skated does not mean it should. Even if you have the skill level to make it down the road, certain variables may be at play making it a bad decision. Local roads you skate all the time may have exceptional traffic that day, or road hazards. Roads that you haven’t skated may have certain qualities that add a lot of danger. Take a good hard look at the risk vs. reward before you kick in. There are certain roads I refuse to skate while others skate there often. I very heavily respect those that back off of a run that they do not personally deem safe. The reality with this sport is that you can do everything right and still get seriously injured.  Don’t get in over your head. Trust your gut, and make sure every decision you make is calculated. </p>
